# Modifications

This is modified from AIYABOT for my Discord server. The goal of these modifications is to focus on using the bot as a tool to make refined images rather than one off generations. I have also removed many sources of delay which allows this bot to generate images significantly faster, especially if multiple people are using this bot.

There is now support for multiple WebUI instances. You can try using this by adding URL, URL1, URL2, etc to your .env file. This also supports the use of USER1, PASS1, APIUSER1, APIPASS1, etc. AIYA Frenzy Bot will use all WebUI instances to speed up batched or queued image generation.

## Setup requirements

- Set up [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion AI Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).
  - AIYA is currently tested on commit `685f9631b56ff8bd43bce24ff5ce0f9a0e9af490` of the Web UI.
- Run the Web UI as local host with api (`COMMANDLINE_ARGS= --listen --api`).
- Clone this repo.
- Create a text file in your cloned repo called ".env", formatted like so:
```dotenv
# .env
TOKEN = put your bot token here
```
- Run AIYA by running launch.bat (or launch.sh for Linux)

## Usage

To generate an image from text, use the /dream command and include your prompt as the query.
