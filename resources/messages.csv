I'm drawing your image.
Please wait warmly until it is ready.
It may take some time.
A few moments, please.
It won't be long.
Please wait coldly.
I'll do my best.
Just a minute... or two.
Wait for me a while.
Bear with me.
Let me see what I can do.
Hang on a moment.
Have some tea while you wait.
I'll get back to you soon.
This is... Well, I'll try.
I'm creating my masterpiece.
I hope you'll like the result.
Let's see what I come up with.
